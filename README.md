## Goal of the project

Tetris Multiplayer is a free *(libre)* and open source project that I have made for my networking and database classes. The goal of it was to make a fully functional pvp tetris multiplayer game that could be played simultaneously by an infinite amount of people.

## Status of the project

Tetris Multiplayer is now playable however multiple features such as friends, ui click sounds, shading and custom skins are still missing therefore the current versions are called "INDEV" since the project is still in development. I plan on finishing the project and making it fully playable if I will have the given time to do so.

## Contribution

If you are interested in contributing to the project please do so - I'd love that! You can contribute to the project by helping me out with one of the following: UI Design, client programming, server programming or sending me new feature ideas using one of the contact methods that I've listed below.

## How-to-play

The game is currently still in INDEV phase version therefore there will be no binaries available for download for a while but don't worry - you can still compile it and check it out for yourself. In order to do so please
